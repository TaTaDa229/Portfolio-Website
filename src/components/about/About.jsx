            “My name is Riley See. I’m a recent elementary education graduate
            from Ball State University. I’ve been working at a camp for
            elementary children this summer, and I’m excited to find my first
            teaching position for the coming school year. I have several
            original lesson plans I created during my teaching internship that I
            look forward to implementing in my own classroom. I attended
            Brookwood Elementary myself and believe I would be a great fit for
            your second grade opening. It would be a joy for me to teach
            students in the same place that sparked my love of learning.”
